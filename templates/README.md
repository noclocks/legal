## Overview

In order to streamline and automate legal document processes and systems, the team at No Clocks, LLC has curated and compiled this collection of legal templates.

We use these templates to create, share, and sign legal documents. We also use them to ensure that our legal documents are consistent, accurate, and up-to-date.

## Standards

We use the [Common Paper Contract Standards](https://commonpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Why-We-Use-Common-Paper-Standard-Agreements.pdf) as the foundation for our legal templates. These standards are open and reflect industry best practices and reasonable terms for both sides of any legal agreement. The standards are created by neutral third-party experts to ensure there is no bias or hidden clauses that could be detrimental to either party. Using a standardized approach allows us to start in the middle and focus on the actual work to be performed.
